    - **`__init__.py`**: Initializes the Flask application and configures the database.
    - **`database.py`**: Database configuration and connection.
    - **`models.py`**: Data model definitions.
    - **`resources.py`**: API resources.
    - **`routes.py`**: API routes definition and control logic.
    - **templates/**: Contains the HTML files used by the application.
- **.venv/**: Virtual environment containing project dependencies.
- **.gitignore**: File to ignore files and directories in version control.
- **LICENSE**: Project license.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.
- **requirements.txt**: List of project dependencies.
- **run.py**: Script to start the Flask server.

## üõ†Ô∏è Running the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local environment.
2. Install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Configure the MySQL database and adjust credentials in the `app/database.py` file.
4. Start the Flask server by running the `run.py` script.

   The server will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## üåê Deployment

For deployment in a production environment, consider using a WSGI server like Gunicorn and a web server like Nginx. Additionally, configure an accessible MySQL database for the application and adjust environment settings as necessary.
